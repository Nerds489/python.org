Here's how to check if Python is installed correctly:

1. Open a terminal (Command Prompt or PowerShell on Windows, Terminal on Mac/Linux) and type:
```bash
python --version
```
or
```bash
python3 --version
```

This should show you the installed Python version (e.g., "Python 3.9.5"). If you see this, Python is installed correctly.

2. You can also test if Python can run by opening the Python interpreter:
```bash
python
```
or 
```bash
python3
```

You should see something like:
```
Python 3.9.5 (default, May 4 2021, 03:33:11) 
[GCC 9.3.0] on linux
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>>
```

3. If you get an error like "python not found" or "python3 not found", then either:
- Python isn't installed
- Python isn't in your system's PATH
- You need to use a different command for your system

4. To verify pip (Python's package installer) is working:
```bash
pip --version
```
or
```bash
pip3 --version
```

If any of these checks fail, you'll need to:
1. Download Python from python.org
2. Run the installer
3. Make sure to check "Add Python to PATH" during installation
4. Restart your terminal after installation

Would you like me to explain any of these steps in more detail?
