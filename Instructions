Let me help you troubleshoot Python not starting in the terminal. This is a common issue that usually stems from Python not being properly added to your system's PATH environment variable or not being installed correctly.

First, let's check if Python is installed and accessible on your system. Here are a few alternative ways to run Python:

1. Try Different Python Commands:
```bash
python --version
# or
python3 --version
# or
py --version
```

If none of these work, we need to verify Python's installation. Here's how to check and fix this:

For Windows Users:
1. Open your Windows search bar
2. Type "Python" - you should see Python in your installed programs
3. If you don't see Python, download it from python.org
4. During installation, make sure to check the box that says "Add Python to PATH"

Alternative Way to Run Python on Windows:
1. Open your Start menu
2. Type "Python" and click on "Python (Version)"
3. This opens IDLE, Python's built-in editor
4. You can also use PyCharm or Visual Studio Code as alternatives to the terminal

For Mac Users:
1. Open Spotlight (Command + Space)
2. Type "Terminal"
3. In Terminal, try:
```bash
which python3
```
This should show you where Python is installed.

For Both Systems - Using an IDE:
Instead of using the terminal, you could use an Integrated Development Environment (IDE):
1. Download and install Visual Studio Code (VS Code)
2. Install the Python extension in VS Code
3. Open your azure_chatbot.py file in VS Code
4. Click the "Run" button (play icon) in the top right

Would you like me to guide you through any of these specific approaches? Or would you like to tell me what operating system you're using so I can provide more targeted instructions?

Also, if you let me know what exactly happens when you try to start Python (any error messages you see), I can give you more specific troubleshooting steps.
